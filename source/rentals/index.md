### COME SEE WHY WE HAVE BEEN RENTING SNOWMOBILES ON THE GROOMED TRAILS OF LAKE ALPINE (40 miles) AND SPICER RESERVOIR (30 miles) with the US Forest Service for over 45 years.

We are the only snowmobile rental operator who has the privilege to rent snowmobiles in this breath taking environment. Our snowmobiles are staged for you at the USFS Sno-Parks so there is no need to trailer or make unsafe crossings over Hwy 4 from Bear Valley. Also, for your safety, two snowmobile minimum per rental during your self-guided tour.

Either make reservations below with our on-line, easy check out calendar, or give us a call at 877-HWY4-FUN (877-499-4386).

PLEASE ARRIVE AN HOUR BEFORE YOUR START TIME FOR THE ALPINE AND SPICER trails at our shop at 132 Bear Valley Road, inside the Bear Valley Transportation Center, to allow for time to fill out the paperwork, helmet fittings and the 1.5 mile drive to the trail head at the Sno-Park.

To rent snowmobiles for the BEAR VALLEY 10 mile long groomed trail we offer snowmobiles with trailers (great for kids!) on a first-come-first-serve basis. During the holidays please allow a 1/2 hour for possible wait times. Give us a call at 877-HWY4-FUN (877-499-4386) and we will let you know what the availability is like.

### Where can you ride our rentals?

Our snowmobiles ready to go at the following trail heads:

*   Spicer Reservoir – view [Spicer Trail map](/files/Spicer_Map.JPG)
*   Bear Valley In Town – view [Village map](/files/Bear_Valley_Village_Map.pdf)

### Who can ride our snowmobiles?

We provide spectacular outdoor adventures the entire family can enjoy. All snowmobile drivers must be at least 18 years old with a valid driver’s license. All of our rentals are late model Ski-Doos with hand and thumb warmers and electric starts for your comfort. All snowmobiles seat two people max – there is no charge for the passenger. Renters are required to provide their own transportation to and from the trailheads, 2-4 miles away unless you ride in the Village area which is right outside our front door. You will need a credit card for each rental contract and to sign a Release of Liability and Acknowledgement of Risk.

### WHAT KIND OF SNOWMOBILES DO WE RENT?

Being a BRP authorized SKI DOO dealer we know how reliable and why SKI DOOs are the most popular snowmobile in the world. We rent newer four stroke SKI DOOs that are regularly maintained and inspected by our SKI DOO certified mechanics. Every machine can sit 2 people – unlike most renters WE DO NOT CHARGE EXTRA FOR PASSENGERS! – so bring friends or the whole family! Maximum of 400 pounds per machine.

### What about little kids?

For children younger then five years old we offer a specially designed front pack “Kid Karrier” for children as young as two. Another great option for the kids is to rent the people carrier – available in the Bear Valley Village only - this “limo” seats two, up to 250lbs – see picture to the right.

### What about elderly folks or the disabled?

For those of us without the muscular strength, coordination, or you are just tired from a long day skiing, snowmobiling lets you see mother nature at her grandest in the wintertime. Snowmobiling primarily uses your arms and thumb to control the throttle. Many who are unable to walk, ski, or snow shoe can still enjoy the winter wilderness on snowmobiles.

*   Gloves
*   Long Johns or Warm Leggings
*   Long Sleeve Turtleneck/Shirt
*   Thick Wool Socks or Synthetic Wool Socks
