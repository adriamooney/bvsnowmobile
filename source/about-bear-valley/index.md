### ABOUT BEAR VALLEY

Nestled half way between Tahoe and Yosemite, Bear Valley is rich in geologic, natural, and historical treasures. West of Bear Valley down Highway 4 is one of the state's most impressive groves of giant sequoia redwoods. Farther west is one of the most charming stretches of California's Gold Rush Country, filled with museums, limestone caverns, gourmet restaurants, Victorian-era bed-and-breakfast inns, antique stores, and a host of vineyards and wineries.
