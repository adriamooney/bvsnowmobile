### Who can ride our snowmobiles?

We provide spectacular outdoor adventures the entire family can enjoy. All snowmobile drivers must be at least 18 years old with a valid driver’s license. All of our rentals are late model Ski-Doos with hand and thumb warmers and electric starts for your comfort. All snowmobiles seat two people max – there is no charge for the passenger. Renters are required to provide their own transportation to and from the trailheads, 2-4 miles away unless you ride in the Village area which is right outside our front door. You will need a credit card for each rental contract and to sign a Release of Liability and Acknowledgement of Risk.

### What about little kids?

We offer the People Trailer on the Bear Valley Village Trail only that seats up to 2 people or 250lbs so a child and adult can ride together.  All passengers must be over 5 years of age on our trails. All children must wear helmets and they must fit them properly.

### What about elderly folks or the disabled?

For those of us without the muscular strength, coordination, or you are just tired from a long day skiing, snowmobiling lets you see mother nature at her grandest in the wintertime. Snowmobiling primarily uses your arms and thumb to control the throttle. Many who are unable to walk, ski, or snow shoe can still enjoy the winter wilderness on snowmobiles.

### What should I bring for the ride?

*   Gloves
*   Long Johns or Warm Leggings
*   Long Sleeve Turtleneck/Shirt
*   Thick Wool Socks or Synthetic Wool Socks
*   Fleece or Sweater
*   Ski Pants or Water Repellent Pants
*   Winter Jacket or Rain Jacket with Extra Sweater
*   Goggles or Sun Glasses
*   Water Repellent Boots or Shoes
*   Sun Screen and Chapstick
*   Backpack for Drinks and Snacks
*   DOT Helmet (we provide the helmets otherwise)
*   And of course a camera!
