### Who can ride our snowmobiles?

We provide spectacular outdoor adventures the entire family can enjoy. All snowmobile drivers must be at least 18 years old with a valid driver’s license. All of our rentals are late model Ski-Doos with hand and thumb warmers and electric starts for your comfort. All snowmobiles seat two people max – there is no charge for the passenger. Renters are required to provide their own transportation to and from the trailheads, 2-4 miles away unless you ride in the Village area which is right outside our front door. You will need a credit card for each rental contract and to sign a Release of Liability and Acknowledgement of Risk.

### What about little kids?

For children younger then five years old we offer a specially designed front pack “Kid Karrier” for children as young as three for the Bear Valley Village Trail only.  Another great option is to rent the people carrier – available in the Bear Valley Village only - this “limo” seats two, up to 250lbs so a child and adult can ride together. The Lake Alpine Trail all passengers must be over 5 years of age. All children must wear helmets and they must fit them properly.

### What about elderly folks or the disabled?

For those of us without the muscular strength, coordination, or you are just tired from a long day skiing, snowmobiling lets you see mother nature at her grandest in the wintertime. Snowmobiling primarily uses your arms and thumb to control the throttle. Many who are unable to walk, ski, or snow shoe can still enjoy the winter wilderness on snowmobiles.

### What should I bring for the ride?

*   Gloves
*   Long Johns or Warm Leggings
*   Long Sleeve Turtleneck/Shirt
*   Thick Wool Socks or Synthetic Wool Socks
*   Fleece or Sweater
